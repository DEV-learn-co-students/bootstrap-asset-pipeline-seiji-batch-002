# Bootstrap Asset Pipeline

## Objectives

1. Identify the components included in bootstrap (namely the CSS and JS required to integrate bootstrap - two main files compressed and minified composed of individual parts).
2. Integrate Bootstrap manually with CDN (not preferred way).
3. Use the bootstrap gem and add the correct requires to your manifest.
4. Rely on bootstrap provided CSS and javascript to power the frontend.

## Objectives

Show the boostrap site and explain that the framework is composed of discrete components.

In general we integrate them all and one easy way to do that, though not prefered is via a CDN.

The prefered way of integrating bootstrap is via the bootstrap gem.

You need to require the bootstrap assets into your manifests.

Once those are there demonstrate how you can utilize and rely on bootstrap classes and javascript to turn your site into something powered by bootstrap.
